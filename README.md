This project is a simple personal portfolio website that provides a description of myself and my education. The website features an interactive navbar with options for Home, About Me, Education, and Contact. Clicking on any of these options will navigate directly to the corresponding section on the site. Additionally, there is a contact form for sending messages to me, and the footer contains a clickable link to my LinkedIn profile, which redirects to my LinkedIn page. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The wave design on my web page was sourced from getwaves.io. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of using the Bootstrap framework in HTML to simplify design and enhance website responsiveness, thereby reducing the need for extensive CSS. I also learned how to incorporate visuals, such as the wave design or necessary icons, from the internet directly into the HTML.
